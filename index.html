                        <p>My name is Lea Hughes, I was born in Clarksdale MS. I always loved composing music, so I went to school to learn how at Full Sail University in Orlando FL.  After receiving my degree in Recording Arts, I took a little road trip to Los Angeles CA and made it my home for 4 years. I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish. I managed to get a few of my songs on TV and even a movie! 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Now, I live in Austin. I teach piano to little aspiring Mozarts at a great school “Lone Star School of Music”. I still write music, but look at it more as a hobby these days. My dream would be to take the over 200 songs I have, and create a music library  website so I can license them out! I can’t wait to know enough about coding to be able to build my dream project, the way I want it.
